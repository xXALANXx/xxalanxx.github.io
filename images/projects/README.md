# Project images

Upload photos for each project into the folder that matches its name:

| Folder | Project |
|--------|---------|
| **Skid-Plate** | Skid Plate |
| **Chaotic-Triple-Pendulum** | Chaotic Triple Pendulum |
| **softwood-table** | Custom Softwood Table |
| **Model-House** | Model House |
| **Dual-Arm-Gripper-End-Effector** | Dual-Arm Gripper End Effector |

**If you had images in the old folders** (`skid-plate`, `model-house`), move their contents into the new folders above so the site can find them:
- `skid-plate/` → **Skid-Plate/**
- `model-house/` → **Model-House/**

Then you can delete the old empty folders. Update the image file paths in `projects-data.js` if you use different filenames.
